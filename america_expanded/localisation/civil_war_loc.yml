 EVTTITLEAECWE.1:0 "The Confederate States of America"
 EVTDESCAECWE.1:0 "With the election of the latest president, a outspoken abolitionist, tensions boiling since the foundation of the nation come to an apex before he even takes office! The Pro-Slavery south is prepared to succeed unless he goes back on his promises to rid the nation of slavery, and word tells they may already be preparing for war! Could the nation even survive if Dixie revolts? Never has a president been faced with such a challenge."
 EVTOPTAAECWE.1:0 "Shout the Battlecry of Freedom!"
 EVTOPTBAECWE.1:0 "In Dixie’s Land I’ll take my stand!"
