 ae_american_empire_events.1.t: "Emperor Washington"
 ae_american_empire_events.1.d: "During his second term, Washington sits in thought. A strange, foreign idea comes to him, and captures his mind for the next week. He had done such a good job. In fact...Maybe Hamilton was right. Maybe president should be for life. In fact, he was elected. Why would future men of his line need be when the ancestor they should aspire to be was elected? Emperor Washington had a good ring to it, after all. But, this could not be so. His allegiance was to America, to democracy! Or was it?"
 ae_american_empire_events.1.a: "Hail to the Emperor!"
 ae_american_empire_events.1.b: "America must never fall to such tyrannical ideals."
 ae_american_empire_events.2.t: "the 66th Document"
 ae_american_empire_events.2.d: "George Washington’s declaration of Empire was met with great resistance. In fact, to calm the people, he went to Hamilton himself. After little convincing Hamilton’s loyalty was won, and Hamilton was designated as Washington’s heir. Than, on Washington’s orders, Hamilton wrote a series of books and pamphlets, totaling  65, to convince the public of the cause of Washington. As Washington sat in his office, debating on how to stop the uproar in the rest of the government, which would be allowed to exist but at a mere fraction of its power, Hamilton came to him with his “66th Document.” A proposed order for Washington’s personal troops, the Liberty Legion, to perform wide scale assassinations on disloyal members of Congress and other political opponents, including those in the army and among the citizenship. This is...truly diabolical. Washington found himself lost in thought. It would secure his rule...but at what cost?"
 ae_american_empire_events.2.a: "Do what must be done!"
 ae_american_empire_events.2.b: "We are not monsters!"
 ae_american_empire_events.2.c: "I have to end this...."
 ae_american_empire_events.3.t: "The Fallout"
 ae_american_empire_events.3.d: "While the order killed many revolutionaries, some still survive! Whispered words tell that the New Sons of Liberty, under Thomas Jefferson, rally in Virginia! Hamilton travels there, prepared to put a stop to it, leading with him a grand army. Hamilton finds their hidden layer and is met by Thomas Jefferson. Thomas unsheathes his blade and challenges him to a duel. The two stand opposed once more. If Jefferson wins, rebellion will surely come..."
 ae_american_empire_events.3.a: "For the Empire!"
 ae_american_empire_events.3.b: "What have I done?"
 ae_american_empire_events.4.t: "Jefferson is Victorious"
 ae_american_empire_events.4.d: "Jefferson was victorious! With the death of Hamilton our entire army routed! It’s commander brought back a message from Jefferson stating that he had chosen liberty or death! Jefferson and his rebel scum have disappeared."
 ae_american_empire_events.4.a: "You have failed me for the last time..."
 ae_american_empire_events.5.t: "Hamilton is Victorious"
 ae_american_empire_events.5.d: "Hamilton is victorious! With the death of the rebel scum it is time for an era of peace and prosperity for our new empire! Surely none will be foolish enough to follow in their doomed footsteps..."
 ae_american_empire_events.5.a: "Glory to the Emperor!"
 ae_american_empire_events.6.t: "Hamilton the Traitor"
 ae_american_empire_events.6.d: "Hamilton has betrayed us! He joined up with Jefferson and together they crushed our army. Alongside the rest of the rebel forces they left for parts unknown, sure to continue the rebellion at another date. He must answer for this betrayal!"
 ae_american_empire_events.6.a: "He will find liberty in death!"
