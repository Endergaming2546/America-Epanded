 ae_american_empire_events.1.t: "Emperor Washington"
 ae_american_empire_events.1.d: "During his second term, Washington sits in thought. A strange, foreign idea comes to him, and captures his mind for the next week. He had done such a good job. In fact...Maybe Hamilton was right. Maybe president should be for life. In fact, he was elected. Why would future men of his line need be when the ancestor they should aspire to be was elected? Emperor Washington had a good ring to it, after all. But, this could not be so. His allegiance was to America, to democracy! Or was it?"
 ae_american_empire_events.1.a: "Hail to the Emperor!"
 ae_american_empire_events.1.b: "America must never fall to such tyrannical ideals."
