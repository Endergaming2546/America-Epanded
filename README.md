# America Expanded
America Expanded is the first mod in the EEFF (Expanded Events, Flavor, and Fixes. WIP name) series, for Europa Universalis IV. Focusing on America, it contains a timeline extension to 2020.12.31, events based on American history (that can be historical, random, triggered or turned off), fixes to things such as its leaders, adds new missions, decisions, and more.
